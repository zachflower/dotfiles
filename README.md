# `.dotfiles`

## Getting Started

Clone this repository using `yadm`.

```
yadm clone git@github.com:zachflower/dotfiles.git
yadm status
```

The `clone` command will attempt to merge your existing dotfiles, but if it fails, it will stash any conflicting data. See [this question](https://yadm.io/docs/faq#i-just-cloned-my-repository-and-conflicting-data-was-overwritten-why) in the yadm FAQ if you need help.

Thatâ€™s all it takes to start. Now most Git commands can be used as yadm <git command>. Read about [common commands](https://yadm.io/docs/common_commands) for ideas.
